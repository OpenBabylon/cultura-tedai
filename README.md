The body of a commit with breaking changes must begin with BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a description of how the API has changed.
- **fix:** Commits that provide fixes for bugs within codebase.
- **docs:** Commits that provide updates to the docs.
- **style:** Commits that do not affect how the code runs, these are simply changes to formatting.
- **lang:** Commits that provide updates of language or fix typos.
- **refactor:** Commits that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **perf:** Commits that improve performance.
- **test:** Commits that add missing or correct existing tests.
